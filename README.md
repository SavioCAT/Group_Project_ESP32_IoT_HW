## Abstract

<p>The main objective of this project was to design a ESP32 network, in order to recover environmental data. In our network we have one master and 4 slaves who are transmitting temperature and humidity data throught ESP-NOW protocol to the master. The main purpose of using this protocol was to make a simple, reliable and energy efficient network.</p><br>

## Code

<p>In our code implementation we used a master-slave model. Where each slave node sends periodical updates about its data to the master node.  </p>

## Demonstration
